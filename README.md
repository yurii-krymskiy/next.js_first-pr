# My Next.js Blogging Platform

Welcome to the My Next.js Blogging Platform! This platform is built using Next.js and leverages various technologies to create a user-friendly commenting system.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js 13:** We've utilized Next.js, a popular React framework, to build this platform. It provides server-side rendering, routing, and other powerful features.

- **React Components:** We've created custom React components to build the user interface, ensuring a smooth and responsive user experience.

- **CSS and Tailwind CSS:** For styling, we've used a combination of standard CSS and Tailwind CSS. Tailwind CSS makes it easy to create consistent and attractive designs.

- **Pocketbase Database:** To store and manage user comments, we've integrated the Pocketbase database. This allows users to interact with posts and leave comments seamlessly.
